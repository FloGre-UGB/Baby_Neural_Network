In this project I built a very simple neural net from scratch. It is based on the article "Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians" 
by Catherine F. Higham, Desmond J. Higham. The data used is taken from the material provided by Hastie et al as suplementary material for their textbook
"An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (see: https://www.statlearning.com/resources-python).
